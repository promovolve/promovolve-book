# Phase 3: Bid Collection

For each selected category, the system fans out to all active campaigns and collects bids. This is the most distributed phase of the auction.

## End-to-End Matching: From Ad Product to Page Content

To understand bid collection, it helps to see the full chain that connects an advertiser's product to a publisher's page. Here's a concrete example with a gym campaign:

**Campaign setup (happens once):**

1. Advertiser creates a campaign and selects ad product: **"Gyms and Health Clubs"** (IAB Ad Product 1512)
2. `ContentToAdProductMapping.getContentForAdProduct("1512")` looks up the IAB mapping
3. No direct mapping for 1512 → walks up to parent **1510** (Fitness Activities)
4. 1510 maps to content categories **{225, 227}** (Fitness and Exercise, Running and Jogging)
5. Campaign stores `categories = Set(225, 227)` — these are the content types this campaign will bid on
6. CampaignDirectory registers the campaign under categories 225 and 227
7. CategoryBidderEntity for categories 225 and 227 now knows this campaign exists

**Page crawl (happens per page):**

8. SiteEntity collects **demand categories** from all active campaigns → `{225, 227}`
9. `buildTaxonomyCandidates` expands these with descendants → `{226, 227}` (Participant Sports, Running and Jogging)
10. This becomes the **candidate list** sent to Gemini — the LLM only sees categories that active campaigns are targeting
11. Gemini classifies the page text using only those categories
12. If it returns 225 or 227 with sufficient confidence, AuctioneerEntity fans out bid requests to CategoryBidderEntity
13. CategoryBidderEntity routes to the gym campaign
14. Campaign bids → candidate created → queued for publisher approval

**Key design decisions:**

- The LLM prompt is **constrained to demand categories** — it only classifies into categories that have active campaigns. This saves tokens and avoids classifying content nobody is advertising for.
- Hallucinated category IDs (where the LLM returns an ID not in the candidate list) are **filtered out** — only valid matches produce auctions.
- The advertiser never sees content categories. They pick their product; the IAB mapping handles the rest.

## CategoryBidderEntity

Each `(category, siteId)` pair uses **5 virtual shards** to distribute load. The shard is selected by `hash(siteId) % 5`, so the actual entity key is `category|siteId|shardIndex`.

## CampaignDistributor

Within each CategoryBidderEntity, a `CampaignDistributor` manages fan-out to individual campaigns using **8 worker actors**, routed by `hash(categoryId) % 8`.

## Bid Request → Response

Each `CampaignEntity` evaluates the request and responds with eligible creatives. The bid CPM is simply the advertiser's max CPM:

```scala
bidCpm = max(maxCpm, floorCpm)
```

Where:
- `maxCpm`: The campaign's configured maximum CPM
- `floorCpm`: The publisher's floor price (auto-optimized by the floor CPM agent)

The advertiser bids their true value. There's no bid shading or multiplier — the quality-adjusted pricing at serve time ensures they only pay what's needed to win, not their full bid.

## Eligibility Filters (Campaign-Side)

A CampaignEntity will not respond if any of these checks fail:

1. **Category mismatch**: The page category is not in the campaign's `categories` set — this is the primary filter. The campaign's categories are derived from its Ad Product Taxonomy 2.0 ID via `ContentToAdProductMapping`, which maps to a set of Content Taxonomy 2.1 IDs. Matching is **exact**: `state.categories.contains(pageCategory)`
2. **Category blocklisted**: The category is in the campaign's `categoryBlocklist` (explicit exclusions)
3. **Status paused**: Campaign `status != Active`
4. **Budget exhausted**: `dailyBudget - (spendToday + bufferedSpend) <= 0`
5. **Day-aware check**: If the calendar day changed since `lastResetInstant`, the budget is treated as fresh (reset happens lazily)
6. **Site blocklisted**: Publisher's site is on the advertiser's `siteBlacklist`
7. **No matching sizes**: None of the campaign's `allowedSizes` fit the slot's `AdSlotConfig(width, height)`

## Aggregation Rules

The CategoryBidderEntity aggregates responses:

1. **CPM threshold**: Only candidates within **top 80%** of the highest CPM are kept: `cpm ≥ maxCpm × (1.0 - 0.80)`. This is deliberately wide — quality-adjusted pricing at serve time handles differentiation among competitive bids.
2. **Campaign cap**: Maximum **50 campaigns** per category (`maxCampaignsPerCategory`), ranked by CPM descending
3. **One creative per campaign**: The highest-CPM creative wins if a campaign has multiple eligible creatives

## Response Structure

Each eligible creative is wrapped in a `Candidate`:

```scala
Candidate(
  creativeId: CreativeId,
  campaignId: CampaignId,
  advertiserId: AdvertiserId,
  cpm: CPM,                              // bidCpm from above
  category: CategoryId,
  creativeHash: String,
  landingDomain: String,
  preApproved: Boolean,
  frequencyCap: Option[Int],
  adProductCategory: Option[AdProductCategoryId]
)
```
